# Week 5 Recitation Notes

## Code Examples
I've added both the `ToDoList` and Star Wars `Planets` examples. You can find them in single-HTML-file format at `swapi_example.html` and `todo_example.html` files. I've also included the expanded versions I demonstrated on codesandbox.io in the `starwars_planets` and `todo_example` directories.

### Running The Examples
If you'd like to run the single-HTML-file versions you can just open them in any browser (or drag-drop the files into a browser window).

In order to run the expanded versions you'll need to have Node installed. Once Node is installed you'll need to change directories to the project directory and run `npm install` first to download and install all of the necessary packages. These will be installed in a `./node_modules` directory within the application directory. To run the server run `npm start`. This will start the HTTP server and open a browser tab with your appllication in it at `localhost:3000`. It will also watch your files and reload that browser tab if you save any changes.
